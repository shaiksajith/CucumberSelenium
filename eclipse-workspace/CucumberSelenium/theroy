gherkin is a language which contains certain num of keywords by using these kewords we will write our test scenarios in featur file

feature file can crate by test engneer or product manager any body can create
every feature contains multiple scenrios and every scnario contains contain multiple steps
the featurfile can be anything but the extension of the file is .feature

for every sceanrio and step we need to create 'step defination' java class

for every step  we have in feature file we need to create corresponding method to each step
after we need run step defination

if we have singke freature file u can run feutur file directly
suppose if u have multiple fetaure files u need to create test runner class, junit class

test runner classs will read all the fetaure file steps and excute correponding step methods

Scenario:

      Given-step is used to set context
      When-step is the action interaction with the system
      Then-step for representing the outcome
      And-step for extendibg the previous step
      
      
    for storing feture we need to create in file in eclpse and in intelli j it is directory
    
    step defination and test runner are java classes
